**SOLID**

Follow the SOLID principle;

- **Single Responsibility** (Classes should focus on one single properly defined responsibility).
- **Open/Closed Responsibility** (Classes/methods/etc should be open for extension but not for modification. Adding functionality should not require altering the existing code).
- **Liskov Substitution** (Subclasses should consistently follow their base class’s functionality).
- **Interface Segregation** (Classes should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use).
- **Dependency Inversion** (Code should depend on interfaces/abstractions which allows flexibility).

**DRY**

Don’t repeat yourself in code, avoid duplicated code fragments at any time.

**KISS**

Write simple, maintainable and readable code. Don’t forget to add comments if they are needed.

**YAGNI**

Delete code that is not being used. Only build features when you need it.

**Don't forget to take showers (not relevant to the scrum master)**

**Naming conventions:**

- **Pascal case:** classes.
- **Camel case:** methods, variables.
- **Snake case:** files, project folders.
- **Clear naming of classes, methods, variables, etc.:** No abbreviations.
