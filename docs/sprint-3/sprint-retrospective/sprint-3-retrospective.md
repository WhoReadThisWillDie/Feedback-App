### Danylo

#### What went well in the last sprint?
In Sprint 3, the team demonstrated strong collaboration, maintained effective communication, and ensured everyone contributed to their tasks. We successfully implemented the video feature and transcription functionality. Additionally, we added a feedback list to enhance the user experience, incorporated more animations, and resolved issues with the mobile UI.

#### What went less well in the last sprint?
During this sprint, we encountered challenges with merging. As a result, we had less time to complete the remaining tasks. Similar to the previous sprint, the client was unavailable for a meeting, forcing us to reschedule it for a later time.

#### What are areas for improvement?
To improve in future projects, we should prioritize better coordination with the client regarding meetings, scheduling them further in advance to avoid delays. Additionally, we need to develop a more robust approach for handling potential issues, such as merge conflicts, to minimize disruptions and ensure smoother progress.

### Julie

#### What went well in the last sprint?
During this sprint, we had the second client meeting that officially belonged to sprint 2. The meeting gave us a final idea of what the client wanted us to deliver as an end product. The team did a great job visualizing it.

#### What went less well in the last sprint?
There was a problem with a merge, which caused certain code to break. As a result, there wasn’t as much time as we hoped to complete the remaining tasks.

#### What are areas for improvement?
To improve in future projects, there should be a protocol about how often a branch needs to be merged into the dev branch, since this sprint, one merge of a branch that hadn’t been up to date to the dev branch caused a merge conflict that caused us to lose time for other tasks.

### Maksim

#### What went well in the last sprint?
In this sprint we were focused on satisfying the client’s requests on design and functionality of the website since the core functionality was already finalized in sprint 2. We added functionality for transcribing and saving video feedbacks, made the UI adaptive for devices with different screen resolutions, and made the process of using our system more convenient by adding animations and rearranging the UI elements on the screen so that the user better understands the process of recording feedback. In my opinion, our team did a great job developing this project during the whole quartile and especially during this sprint, and every team member took an active role in this process.

#### What went less well in the last sprint?
When merging our changes, there was a significant merge conflict caused by one of the contributors not picking up the latest version of the branch before starting to work on their task. This forced us to spend some time resolving it and restoring the functionality lost as a result of this merge. However, we were able to restore everything in a timely manner and continue working on the other tasks.

#### What are areas for improvement?
In future team projects, we should be more explicit about the rules for pulling and merging branches when it comes to working with a version control system. This will prevent misunderstandings and incidents like the one described above. Perhaps we could schedule all meetings with the client at the beginning of the project, rather than each meeting at the beginning of each sprint. That way, we would have had a better idea of when the client is available for meetings and we would not have to rearrange our plans.

### Mihaela

#### What went well in the last sprint?
During sprint 3 we gathered even more insights about the project. With the constructive client feedback we received, we managed to develop a product according to their needs. We finished all of the planned tasks and more. The communication among the team continues to be good and we are working in a positive atmosphere.

#### What went less well in the last sprint?
Due to the inability to schedule a client meeting at the end of Sprint 2 or the very beginning of Sprint 3, we had to adapt to the situation and start with our tasks without any feedback. This situation was a bit of a throwback considering the importance of the client's opinion and the postponed planning of Sprint 3, which slowed down the development process. Furthermore, in the last days of sprint 3 we ran into merging problems and we lost a big part of the work we had already done. This issue led to team members waiting for the problem to be fixed and other team members redoing tasks they have already done.

#### What are areas for improvement?
For future team projects, we have to be more considerate when it comes to merging branches and be prepared when issues with them occur, so that we can avoid the same problems we encountered this sprint. Another point for improvement is the communication with the client. For future projects we need to schedule the meetings in advance so that we won’t be left in the dark for a long time.

### Simona

#### What went well in the last sprint?
In Sprint 3, the team worked well together, we continued to have good communication and everyone contributed to their tasks. We implemented the video feature and transcription. We also added a list of feedback, improving the user experience, added more animations, and fixed the mobile UI.

#### What went less well in the last sprint?
This sprint we faced a problem when merging. A team member accidentally deleted 3 people’s work so we had some problems fixing the project afterwards. This problem took several days, therefore we had less time to finish up the remaining tasks. Also similarly to the last sprint, the client was not available for a meeting, so we had to postpone it to when he was available.

#### What are areas for improvement?
For future projects, we need to have better communication with the client regarding the meetings and probably schedule them more in advance, so that we do not run into the same issues. Another thing we can improve on is having a better approach when we encounter potential issues (for example: merging problems).

### Syandana

#### What went well in the last sprint?
During Sprint 3, as it was the final stretch, the team put in all the effort to finalize the product. We managed to implement the video recording and saving feature, as well as being able to access the saved recordings and transcriptions per the request of the client. Mobile UI was also improved and I believe we did an incredible job.

#### What went less well in the last sprint?
Merging proved to be troublesome as some components in the front end disappeared and a lot of time was spent trying to fix those merge errors. The availability of the client also proved to hinder some plans.

#### What are areas for improvement?
In the future, for other projects, especially those that include a real client, we should try and improve communications, and plan meetings way ahead of time in order for us to have a fixed timeline and proper planning.
