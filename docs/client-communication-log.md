## Client meetings

### Client meeting 21.11.2024
During the meeting, the focus was on enhancing the feedback workflow for student assignments.
Instead of assigning final grades, feedback will be prioritized in the form of rubrics, scores,
and spoken comments. To ensure value retention, spoken feedback should be transcribed and saved
alongside the original audio or video file. The platform must allow students to give and receive feedback,
including self-assessments, with all feedback being writable and storable. Users should have the ability
to restart recordings in case of disturbances. The client emphasized the use of AI for local feedback
analysis without relying on third-party services, maintaining strict data confidentiality.
Assignments and feedback will be stored securely within the application, ensuring stability and security.

Forms should be editable before submission, and the platform must support multilingual capabilities (English, Dutch, and German). Key features
include the ability to record audio, video, and text feedback while saving transcripts within the system.
Technical decisions and concepts will be presented in an upcoming live demo, which must highlight a stable,
user-friendly interface. Communication with the client will primarily occur through Discord or via email
at office@scorion.com.

### Client meeting 05.12.2024
In the follow-up meeting, discussions focused on simplifying and refining the feedback collection process.
The structure now requires students to create forms that teachers will complete, with the forms supporting
text fields and options for recording audio and video feedback. The design will feature a clean, white background
to ensure ease of use and visual clarity. The platform will shift its focus away from assignment-related features,
emphasizing the seamless integration of text, audio, and video functionalities for feedback collection.
