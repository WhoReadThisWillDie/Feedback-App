### Danylo
**What went well in the last sprint?**  
In Sprint 2, the team demonstrated strong collaboration and effective communication, with everyone contributing meaningfully to their tasks. We successfully finalized the audio transcription feature by integrating Whisper into the backend and connecting it to the frontend. Additionally, we enhanced the user experience by adding animations and making UI improvements.

**What went less well in the last sprint?**  
A significant challenge this sprint was the inability to meet with the client as planned. Despite preparing a presentation and live demo, the client’s unavailability meant we couldn’t gather their feedback at the end of the sprint.

**What are areas for improvement?**  
In the next sprint, we should focus on improving flexibility in our planning to better accommodate potential delays in client meetings or feedback.

### Julie
**What went well in the last sprint?**  
We made a lot of progress and the client was satisfied with what we accomplished this sprint. Almost all required functionalities are implemented and a great amount of features are connected to each other now.

**What went less well in the last sprint?**  
Acquiring a meeting with our client was the biggest challenge this sprint. Because of the time of year (Christmas break), we had to reschedule to a date after the original Sprint 2 deadline, which moved our Sprint 3 up and also made it shorter.

**What are areas for improvement?**  
I feel that the team has been delivering great work, and the only thing that we had been struggling with was planning a meeting with the client. So probably the team could be more flexible with scheduling meetings so that sprints aren’t set back.

### Maksim
**What went well in the last sprint?**  
The team made great progress on redesigning the visual part of the application in accordance with the client's requirements, connecting backend and frontend, implementing new features. Everyone actively participated in the meetings and contributed to project development.

**What went less well in the last sprint?**  
The team had to reschedule a meeting with the client to the beginning of the next sprint due to the specifics of their schedule, which had a slight effect on the organization of the team's work, since we were not able to share progress and receive feedback in a timely manner.

**What are areas for improvement?**  
In my opinion, the team works well, so I can't point out any areas for improvement. In the next sprint, we should focus on refactoring the project based on the client's feedback and implementing additional functionality since almost all the main requirements have been already met.

### Mihaela
**What went well in the last sprint?**  
During Sprint 2 we managed to correct the mistakes we made during Sprint 1 and finish with connecting all parts of the project into one fully working product. We had a better understanding of what the client needed so we were confident in researching the video functionality with the intention of implementing it in Sprint 3. We focused on documentation as well, which in my opinion was a necessary step. By the end of the sprint, I can say that we are on track with the project.

**What went less well in the last sprint?**  
Unfortunately, this sprint overlapped with our deadlines for the retakes from the previous quartile, which challenged us in terms of time and workflow management. Due to this overlap, we lost almost a week of proper work and most of the team members were focusing on the retakes rather than the team project. Another reason for delays in the tasks was that many team members were sick during the sprint, which led to missing meetings and taking more time to finish their tasks. However, I think that our team managed to overcome these challenges and we delivered a decent product in the end of the sprint.

**What are areas for improvement?**  
I think that our team is doing good in all aspects, we are communicating and working well together. For the next sprint, we agreed to be more flexible and always prepared for possible changes in schedules and circumstances.

### Simona
**What went well in the last sprint?**  
In Sprint 2, the team continued to work well together, we had good communication and I liked that everyone contributed effectively to their tasks. We successfully finalized the implementation of the audio transcription feature, integrating Whisper into the backend and connecting it to the frontend. We added animations and made UI improvements to further enhance the user experience. We also did an initial research into the video feedback functionality, to prepare us for potential future work in Sprint 3.

**What went less well in the last sprint?**  
One challenge we faced this sprint was the inability to meet with the client as planned. Although we prepared the presentation and a live demo, the client’s unavailability meant we could not receive their feedback in time, and therefore we had to reschedule the meeting a week later, making Sprint 2 longer than we expected. This affected us because for a week we did not have an input to guide our priorities moving into Sprint 3. Another thing that delayed our work for Sprint 2 was that some team members had retakes, so they took longer than usual to complete the tasks, but this was not a major issue.

**What are areas for improvement?**  
For the next sprint, we can focus on improving flexibility in our planning to accommodate potential delays in client meetings or feedback. This could include scheduling meetings earlier in the sprint or setting up alternative ways to get feedback on our work. Besides this, I do not think we have another area that needs improvement.

### Syandana
**What went well in the last sprint?**  
During Sprint 2, I believe that the team managed to work incredibly well together. We finished all the tasks we planned for the sprint and we all believe that we now have a product that we all hoped to have by the end of the sprint. Similar to the previous sprint, tasks were divided evenly among all members, and there was evident teamwork among all the members. Merges were smooth as conflicts were solved immediately when they showed up.

**What went less well in the last sprint?**  
We had to reschedule our meeting with the client, causing us to meet the client sometime in Sprint 3. There were also some days that some members were sick, but despite these events, we managed to continue on.

**What are areas for improvement?**  
I believe that the team already has ample communication, teamwork, and flexibility. In the next sprint, I believe that we should continue our hard work and aim to maintain our flexibility in the case of unwanted events occurring.
