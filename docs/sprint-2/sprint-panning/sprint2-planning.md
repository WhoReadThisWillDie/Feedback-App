# Sprint 2 planning

## Targets for Sprint 2
1. Refactor the User Interface (UI) Based on Updated Client Requirements
* Review feedback and new requirements provided by the client and analyze how they impact the current UI design.
* Update the UI layout, components, and functionality to align with the revised expectations.
* Ensure the changes maintain usability and aesthetic consistency and are validated by the client before finalizing.
* Establish the Connection Between Frontend and Backend

2. Implement API endpoints in the backend to facilitate communication with the frontend.
* Ensure seamless data exchange between the frontend and backend components, including real-time updates where required.
* Test the integration to confirm the functionality is responsive and error-free.
* Set Up Backend and Database Integration

3. Connect the backend logic to the database, ensuring CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations work as expected.
* Test database queries and data flow to confirm the backend retrieves and updates data correctly.
* Implement security measures such as input validation and sanitization to protect the database from vulnerabilities.
* Document Features Implemented in Sprint 1

4. Create clear and detailed documentation covering all features developed in Sprint 1, including:
* The initial UI design and its core components.
* The database schema, its structure, and key relationships.
* The implemented transcription functionality, including API details and any limitations.
* Ensure the documentation is user-friendly and accessible to all team members.
* Refactor the Database to Reflect Updated User Requirements

5. Analyze how new client or user requirements impact the current database structure.
* Modify the database schema to accommodate the changes, ensuring the design remains optimized and scalable.
* Test all dependent backend functionalities to ensure the updates do not cause any disruptions.
* Begin Researching and Exploring Video Functionality

6. Investigate potential methods or APIs for integrating video processing into the system, focusing on features like video uploading, and transcription.
* Evaluate technical requirements, feasibility, and compatibility with the existing system architecture.
* If feasible, start initial implementation of video-related functionality, beginning with simple tasks such as video file uploads or format handling.

## Sprint 2 review 
During Sprint 2, the team successfully adapted to new client requirements and made significant strides in the development of the system, 
fulfilling all planned targets and achieving additional improvements to enhance the user experience. The sprint began with a thorough 
review of the updated client feedback, which guided the necessary adjustments to the user interface (UI). These refinements, including 
the addition of animations to improve user experience, were implemented seamlessly while ensuring usability and consistency across the 
design. The updated UI was validated with the client, ensuring it met their expectations.

The team also achieved substantial progress in system integration. By the end of the sprint, the frontend, backend, and database were 
fully connected, enabling seamless data flow throughout the system. CRUD operations were implemented and rigorously tested to ensure 
reliable functionality. Security measures such as input validation and sanitization were incorporated to safeguard the system against 
vulnerabilities. This integration marked a significant milestone as it resulted in a working initial product, demonstrating the core 
features of the system.

Documentation of the features implemented in Sprint 1 was completed, providing clear and detailed descriptions of the initial UI design, 
database schema, and transcription functionality. This documentation serves as a valuable resource for the team, promoting clarity 
and continuity as the project progresses. Additionally, the database was refactored to accommodate the new requirements, ensuring 
scalability and alignment with the clientâ€™s updated needs. Dependencies were tested thoroughly to avoid disruptions caused by these 
changes.

Finally, the team dedicated time to researching video functionality, exploring potential APIs and methods for integrating video 
processing into the system. An initial implementation was undertaken, focusing on basic tasks such as video uploads and format handling. 
This groundwork will enable smoother progress in subsequent sprints as the team delves deeper into video processing capabilities.

Overall, Sprint 2 was highly productive, with the team achieving a well-connected and functional initial product, adapting to evolving 
requirements, and laying the foundation for future enhancements. Furthermore, the client was happy with the product we presented and the 
progress we made during the past 2 weeks. With his feedback and the job we have done, the project can proceed strongly 
to the next stages of development!
