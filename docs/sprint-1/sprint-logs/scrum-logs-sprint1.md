**Danylo**

- **Task I was working on:**  Setup endpoints and routers on the backend
- **Status:** Not done yet, still in progress but will be down till tomorrow
- **Any blockers?**  Nope

**Julie**

- **What I have done**: Finished the audio recording functionality implementation
- **Any problems**: None

**Mihaela**

- **Task I was working on:** Create component for audio file
- **Status:** The task is almost complete. The only missing part is design.
- **Any blockers?** No

**Simona**

- **Task I was working on**: implement early database
- **Status**: Done
- **Any blockers**: None

**Dana**

- **Task I was working on:** database design
- **Status:** done
- **Any blockers:** nope

**Maksim**

- **Task I was working on:** Implement the audio transcription functionality
- **Status:** Done, but could be better. I will try to implement sentence division before tomorrow's meeting
- **Any blockers:** None related to development, but I don't know how to commit my code to the repo. Transcription functionality requires adding ai model files to the repo, but the model itself weighs several gigabytes, so it definitely shouldn't be in the repo. For now I can add model to the .gitignore and make a guide on how to install it in your projects so that you could get the transcription functionality until I come up with a better solution

**Danylo**

- **Task I was working on:** Switch to Whisper AI model for speech recognition
- **Status:** Not done
- **Any blockers?** Some issue pop up when I tried to install new dependencies from package.json. Seems like my Node version is too old or I just need to reinstall it to use npm.
