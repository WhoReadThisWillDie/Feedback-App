# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct serves as a foundation for collaboration, ensuring productivity and mutual respect
within our team. The following guidelines, agreed upon by all members, should be adhered to in 
order to maintain a supportive and efficient work environment.

### 1. Punctuality for Class and Meetings
- Be on time for class and meetings. If a team member is late by more than 20 minutes, 
they will receive a strike.

### 2. Respect for Team Members
- Treat all teammates with respect and professionalism. Harassment or unprofessional
behavior will not be tolerated.

### 3. Open Communication
- Communicate any issues or challenges openly with the team as soon as they arise. 
Constructive communication is key to overcoming obstacles together.

### 4. Attendance Notification
- Inform the team if you are unable to attend a meeting or class at least the evening before. 
If the reason is not valid, the team member receives a strike.
- Inform the teacher if you are not able to attend a class. This keeps the integrity of our team.

### 5. Feature Branching Workflow
- We will use Git feature branching to manage our work. This ensures that each task or feature is 
independently developed and reviewed before integration.

### 6. Team Support Before Deadlines
- If you need assistance, reach out to teammates before the deadline. Do not hold back the team if 
help is available. If an issue like that arises the team member will receive a strike.

### 7. Accountability for Assigned Tasks
- If you have been assigned a task, be able to show proof of work. Lack of accountability will result 
in a strike.

### 8. SCRUM Meetings
- Every sprint will include at least one SCRUM meeting outside of class. The timing of these meetings 
will be decided individually for each sprint.

### 9. Time Registration
- Keep track of time spent on tasks. Accurate time registration helps in planning and workload
assessment.

### 10. Constructive Feedback
- When giving feedback, be constructive and focused on improvement. Feedback should aim to 
support each other's growth and enhance team performance.

Each member is expected to follow these guidelines consistently. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in strikes or further 
disciplinary actions, as deemed appropriate by the team. Let's work together to create a productive, 
respectful, and enjoyable working environment.
