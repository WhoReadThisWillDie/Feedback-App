# Definition of Done
In our group project, we have established a clear definition of done to ensure that tasks are completed and ready for integration into the project. This definition consists of the following criteria:

## Specific:
We aim to complete code implementation for each task, aligning with the team's standards and best practices to ensure the required functionality and consistency across the project.
## Measurable:
A task is deemed done when it has gone through a comprehensive manual testing phase, where its functionality, stability, and compatibility are confirmed. If there are any bugs or issues, these are addressed and resolved. The task's completion can also be determined when it is committed to our version control system with the necessary code changes.
## Achievable:
Every task needs to be manageable and achievable within the given timeframe and resources. If a task seems too large or complex, it will be broken down into subtasks to ensure manageability.
## Relevant:
Each task must contribute to the overall project objectives. It's important to ensure that all completed tasks are committed and pushed to the GitLab repository, promoting effective collaboration, maintaining high code quality, and tracking project progress.
## Time-bound:
Each task must have a clear deadline. The timeframe will be established at the task assignment stage and will take into account the complexity of the task and the team's capacity.

By adhering to these SMART criteria, we ensure that each task is not just completed, but that it is done so in a way that contributes effectively to the success of our group project.
